    <div id="cloud" class="P2">Stillness in Motion
        <br>— Cloud Cities</div>
    <div id="bigImage"></div>
    <div class=text id="text1">Stillness in Motion — Cloud Cities, imagines alternative possible scenarios for futures,
        conjuring an era in which humanity ceases to negatively impact our planet’s fossil-fuel resources. Part of
        Saraceno’s larger body of work titled Aerocene, it shows us how it is possible to become airborne in collective
        sustainable environments. The Aerocene multiple artistic experiments re-calibrate our sensory systems,
        catalyzing the emergence of new ways of inhabiting the world.

        Stillness in motion refers to how it feels to float in the air, condensing the gap between our perception and
        experience of the ocean of air at the bottom of which we dwell. When it comes to buoyancy – the tendency or
        capacity to remain afloat in a liquid or rise <br>in air or gas – or more precisely to experience buoyancy the
        sensible dimension seems to override the scientific thermodynamical and physical explanations or
        implications.
        This buoyancy can be defined as intense weightlessness: becoming lighter than air to challenge gravity.
        Becoming
        airborne, being able to travel without sensing it or at least to sense it outside of our ways of perceiving
        space-time relations, is paradoxically remaining still and being in motion at the same time.

    <div id="bigImage2"></div>
    <div class=text id="text2">How are we embedded as a part of the cosmic web? Can we consider an insect and the
        vibratory cosmos in the same network of relationships? What are the possibilities for better attunement? How
        do
        we fly with our feet on the ground…

        Our Interplanetary Bodies appeals not to science fiction or fairytale fantasy, but to the possibility of
        realizing a utopian vision for the not-so-distant future. The phenomena of the mysterious Universe is made
        sensible through an organic and poetic consilience of different disciplines…. a creative contemplation on a
        more-than-human relationship and cosmic becoming.

    <div class=text id="text3">The Aeroreflector invites a collective turn towards the most important energy source for
        earthly life, the Sun. In positioning our tools-for-change towards it, we enter into an active multi-directional
        relationship with our brightest shining star, forming an act of hope-filled togetherness and solidarity with the
        Earth’s natural surface reflectivity, known as albedo. Based on a truncated pyramid concept developed long
        before the Anthropocene, the parabolic structure of the Aeroreflector reveals generational connections across
        various cultures, materialising methodical parabolic techniques, essentially formulating a solar thermal
        collector for heating. The concept of concentrating light using curved mirrors has historically helped
        civilisations to use collective efforts to heat, cook, and to share meals from renewable energy sources,
        collaborating with simple forms of abundant elemental energies instead of the extraction of commodity fuels for
        combustion-based process of heat generation, at the expense of all natural phenomena, ourselves included. In
        becoming more familiar with direct solar energy, discovering the warmth from this life-providing star and the
        ocean of air through which it transmits, we can rearticulate the way energy and heating power has been (ab)used
        since the dawn of a human-influenced geologic age. Turning our attention to new circular modes of nourishing
        each other and the planet simultaneously, we enter into a renewed reflective practice; one in which we re-attune
        to the Earth, adhering not only to ourselves but interplanetary rhythms, other species and nature itself too.
        Through this multidisciplinary exchange, we collectively attempt to understand how the sun made us, and what the
        sun could make of us, if we begin to sense it differently.
