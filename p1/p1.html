                Cloud storage is a sufficient way for saving documents or other electronical things that people
                use currently. Compare to the other ways, save things on the internet or cloud storage saves more space
                and
                more convenient. Carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases that support human activities,
                they
                are also the amount of carbon dioxide that a person or organization produces by the things they do, used
                as
                a way of measuring the amount of harm they do to the environment.</p>

            <p>As a result, there are tons of carbon dioxide produced everyday with our daily activities. Unlike the
                traditional paper print to save documents and other things, cloud saving can cut down the waste of paper
                and
                natural materials. However, the carbon dioxide is also producing while all the computer actions going
                on.</p>

            <p>Cloud storage has a lot of benefits such as saving the space and natural energy. However, since the
                computer
                and internet can cost electricity and carbon dioxide.</p>

            &quot;Saving and storing 100 gigabytes of data in the cloud per year would result in a carbon footprint of
            about 0.2 tons of CO2, based on the usual U.S. electric mix.&quot;
