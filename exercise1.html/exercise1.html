                The 7.5-mile (12-km) wide asteroid struck the Earth 66 million years ago and caused 75% of life on the
                planet to become extinct, according to research led by the University of Texas and published in the PNAS
                journal.
                It is thought the event triggered wildfires over 900 miles away, as well as sparking a devastating
                tsunami. </p>
            <p>
                Many dinosaurs would have died that day, but others may have perished from the atmospheric fall-out that
                followed. Scientists think the earth cooled dramatically after sulfur was released into the atmosphere,
                blocking the sun and killing off life. </p>
            <p>
                The new research was based on rocks collected in 2016 from the Chicxulub impact site off the coast of
                the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
                Professor Sean Gulick, who led the study, told CNN: "For me personally, successfully collecting the
                cores from the peak ring of the Chicxulub crater was the fruit of years of proposal writing and planning
                made reality.
                "It was a truly exciting moment when we first encountered the sediments from the impact itself and
                moreover when we realized we were seeing events in such detail." </p>
            <p>
                Gulick added that the project presented an unusual opportunity for geologists to read the "rock record,"
                as 130 meters of rock in the crater represented the events of the single day when the asteroid struck.
                Typically, one centimeter of rock represents every 1,000 years.
